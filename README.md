- Utilize XGBoost regression for modeling.
- Evaluate with MAE and RMSE metrics.
- Generate segment-based LTV curves and CSV reports.

### 3. Campaign Performance Analysis & Growth Optimization
- Calculate ROAS.
- Compare channel performances.
- Analyze funnel drop-off rates.
- Recommend budget reallocations.
- Visualize KPIs via dashboards.

### 4. Marketing & Game Update Synchronization
- Assess impact of game updates on user behavior.
- Compare D1/D7 retention pre- and post-update.
- Analyze creative success tied to update features.
